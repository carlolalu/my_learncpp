/*
Here I try to implement what I learned about multilevel pointers and
dereferencing to the case o0f memory allocation. In particular I see that the
operator new returns ALWAYS a 1 level pointer to the kind of object after it. If
it is a multi-level array, then it gets treated as an array with respect to the
last squared parenthesis. Precisely: type *ptr {new (std::nothrow) type};
//single value type *ptr {new (std::nothrow) type[x]};        //array of values
 type (*ptr)[a][b] {new (std::nothrow) type[x][a][b]}        //multidimensional
array where a b are CONSTEXPR
 * basically I never know the last dimension. NEVER, because I get returned
always a pointer.
 *
 * There is still A LOT of work which needs to be done to take confidence with
which sqaured parenthesis operator\ does have the privilege to not be returned
to the pointer. Precisely is the leftmost one, but what is the meaning of it,
and hwo to use on a practical level? I need to do some exercise with multi-level
pointers, multi-dimensional arrays and dynamic memory allocation all together
 and array of pointers to multi-diumensional arrays or similar. A world of
reference to be discovered
